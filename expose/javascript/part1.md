1. `20`, because `add` is `true` and the code branches to the `if` branch in line 3. The `result` variable is set to 0, and subsequently the sum `10 + 10 = 20`.
2. `20`, because the `if` branch was executed, `result` becomes accessible within the entire function. Thus, line 13 also prints `20`.
3. Using `var`s can lead to naming conflicts and scoping issues.
4. `20`, for the same reason as 1: because `add` is `true` and the code branches to the `if` brnach, the `result`, which is the sum `10 + 10 = 20`, is displayed.
5. `Uncaught ReferenceError: result is not defined` would be printed, since `result` is not a variable in the current scope at line 13.
6. Line 9 would not be executed, but the code would print `Uncaught TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'result'` before line 9. This is because the assignment in line 8 to the `const` variable `result` is invalid.
7. Line 13 is unreachable; nothing would be printed.
